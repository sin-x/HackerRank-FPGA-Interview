### Question 1 
**Select the boolean equation that matches the following truth table:**

| A | B | C | O |
| - | - | - | - |
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 |

- [x] (A xor B) and C
- [ ] A or (B and C)
- [ ] A xnor B
- [ ] B
- [ ] B and C
- [ ] A xor (B xor C)

> *Explanation:*
> One way to solve this is to make the truth tables of all the options and select the one that matches.
> There is a quicker way, by exluding options, one-by-one.
> If we look at the **last line** of the truth table, it is obvious that all the options - except the first one - cannot be the answer, because the output should be 1 in all those cases. 
> At this point we have only one option to check its truth table.


### Question 2
**Select the boolean equation that matches the following truth table:**

| A | B | C | O |
| - | - | - | - |
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |

- [ ] (A xor B) and C
- [ ] A or (B and C)
- [x] A xnor C
- [ ] B
- [ ] B and C
- [ ] A xor (B xor C)

> *Explanation:*
> Same as the previous question. This time, if we look at the **first line** of the truth table, we can exclude all the options - except the third one - because the output should be 0 in all those cases.
